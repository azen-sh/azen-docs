title: "API Overview"
---

This section documents the **Azen HTTP API** for storing, retrieving, and searching memories.

If you're building AI agents or memory-aware applications, this is where you'll spend most of your time.

---

## Base URL

All API requests are made against:
```http
https://api.azen.sh/api/v1/
```

All endpoints in this section are relative to this base URL.

---

## Authentication

Azen uses **API key authentication**.

Every request must include your API key in the headers:
```http
azen-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### How authentication works

* Each API key represents a **private namespace**.
* All memories created using a key belong only to that namespace.
* You don't manage users or sessions.
* Azen automatically handles isolation and access control.

### Example request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.azen.sh/api/v1/memory \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'azen-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "text": "User likes cold brew coffee",
  "dedupKey": "preference:coffee"
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Authentication errors

| Code  | Meaning             |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| `401` | API key missing     |
| `403` | API key invalid     |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |

## What the API allows you to do

Using the Azen API, you can:

* Store user or agent memories
* Retrieve stored memories
* Delete existing memories
* Perform semantic search over stored memories

## Core endpoints

These are the main API capabilities you'll work with:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Create memory"
    icon="plus"
    href="/api-reference/create-a-new-memory"
  >
    Store a new memory in your namespace.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="List memories"
    icon="list"
    href="/api-reference/list-user-memories"
  >
    List paginated memories for your API key.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Get memory"
    icon="database"
    href="/api-reference/retrieve-a-memory-by-id"
  >
    Retrieve a memory by its ID.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Delete memory"
    icon="trash"
    href="/api-reference/delete-a-memory"
  >
    Permanently delete a stored memory.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Search memories"
    icon="magnifying-glass"
    href="/api-reference/search-user-memories"
  >
    Run semantic search across your memory store.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Error format

All errors returned by API follow a consistent structure:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "error message",
  "code": error code,
  "details": {}
}
```

### Common error codes

| Code  | Meaning                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| `400` | Invalid JSON or invalid request body |
| `401` | Missing API key                      |
| `403` | Invalid API key                      |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded                  |
| `500` | Internal server error                |

Validation errors may also include extra data in `details`.

## Security tips

* Never expose your API key in frontend code
* Use environment variables to store your key
* Use different keys for staging and production
* Rotate keys regularly
