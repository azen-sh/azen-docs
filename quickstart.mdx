This quickstart shows you how to get started with **Azen using the SDK**.

You'll:
- **Install the Azen SDK**
- **Create your first memory**
- **Retrieve context using natural language**

All in under 5 minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Go to the Azen dashboard and create an API key:

    👉 **https://app.azen.sh**

    Copy your API key — you'll use it to initialize the SDK.

    <Info>
      Your API key is securely sent with every request and is automatically scoped to your workspace, ensuring data isolation by default.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install SDK">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm
      npm install @azen-sh/sdk
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Support for additional runtimes and languages is coming soon.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your API key">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript JavaScript
      import Azen from '@azen-sh/sdk';

      const client = new Azen({
        apiKey: process.env.AZEN_API_KEY,
      });
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    That's it — no manual HTTP requests, headers, or fetch logic required.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a memory">
    Store your first memory using natural language.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript JavaScript
      const response = await client.memory.create({
        text: "I love hiking in the mountains",
      });
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### What happens under the hood?

    When you write data through the SDK:

    1. The memory is stored in your private namespace
    2. The content is automatically embedded
    3. The memory becomes searchable without any extra work

    You don't manage databases, embeddings, or background jobs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search memories">
    Retrieve context using natural language queries.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript JavaScript
      const results = await client.memory.search({
        query: "What outdoor activities does the user enjoy?",
      });

      console.log(results);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    The SDK returns the most relevant memories, ready to be passed into an LLM, agent, or application workflow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Complete Semantic Memory Workflow

You just completed a full semantic memory workflow using the Azen SDK:

1. Got your API key
2. Installed the SDK
3. Stored structured context
4. Retrieved it using natural language

All without setting up a vector database or writing custom retrieval logic.
