Azen is a **memory API** for AI agents and applications.

Instead of wiring your own vector database, queues, and deduplication logic, Azen gives you a simple set of endpoints to:

- **Store memories** for each user or agent  
- **Search those memories** with semantic relevance  
- **Deduplicate** repeated inputs using an optional `dedupKey`  
- Keep everything **namespaced per user** for safety

> Think of Azen as the _memory layer_ that sits between your model and your app.

## How it fits into your stack

1. Your app or agent observes something important  
2. You call **`POST /memory`** to store it  
3. Azen queues an **embedding job** and persists the memory  
4. Later, you call **`POST /memory/search`** with a natural-language query  
5. Azen returns the **most relevant memories** to feed back into your model

You don't manage indexes, embeddings, or vector stores – Azen does.

## Core primitive: Memory

A **memory** is a small piece of text tied to a user:
```json
{
  "id": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a",
  "content": "User prefers cold brew coffee.",
  "metadata": {
    "dedupKey": "preference:coffee"
  },
  "createdAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "embedded": true
}
```
