Azen is an infrastructure layer that gives AI applications **long-term memory**.

Most AI systems today are stateless, they forget everything between requests.  
Azen fixes that by providing a dedicated memory and retrieval layer for your AI.

---

## Why Azen exists

When building AI agents or assistants, you usually have to stitch together:

- **A vector database**  
- **An embedding pipeline**  
- **A retrieval system**  
- **Background jobs**  
- **A deduplication mechanism**  
- **Access control per user**  

That stack is complex, fragile, and expensive to maintain.

**Azen handles all of that for you.**

You focus on building intelligent behavior.  
Azen handles memory infrastructure.

## What Azen provides

With Azen, you get:

- **Persistent memory for AI applications**  
- **Semantic memory retrieval**  
- **Secure, namespaced storage per API key**  
- **Optional memory deduplication**  
- **A simple HTTP API**  

All without running vector databases or background workers yourself.

## Who Azen is for

Azen is designed for:

- **AI agent developers**  
- **LLM application builders**  
- **Developers who want stateful AI without infrastructure pain**
