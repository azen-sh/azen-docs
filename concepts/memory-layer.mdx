# What is the Memory Layer

The memory layer is the core idea behind Azen:  
a **persistent semantic memory system** for AI agents and AI-powered applications.

Unlike normal databases that just store text or objects, a memory layer stores information in a way that models and agents can:

- understand  
- search semantically  
- retrieve later for reasoning  

Think of it as an **external brain** for your AI. It remembers things over time and helps your system build context, not just logs.

## Why a Memory Layer?

Most AI applications today are **stateless**.  
Your model only knows what is in the current prompt.

This creates problems:

- You re-send user data every time  
- Prompts become huge and expensive  
- The AI forgets things between sessions  

Azen’s memory layer fixes this by giving your AI a **long-term semantic memory** instead of temporary context.

## How it works in Azen

Azen stores memories using semantic embeddings and vector search.

This means:

1. You send text to Azen  
2. Azen converts it into an embedding (vector)  
3. That vector is stored and indexed  
4. Later, you search by meaning, not keywords  

So if a user says:

> “I like cold brew coffee”

A later query like:

> “What drink does the user prefer?”

will still match that memory, even if the wording is different.

## What is a Memory?

A **memory** in Azen is one small, meaningful piece of information.
It’s usually a single fact, preference, observation, or decision.

Example structure:

```json
{
  "id": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a",
  "content": "User prefers cold brew coffee.",
  "metadata": {
    "dedupKey": "preference:coffee"
  },
  "createdAt": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
  "embedded": true
}
